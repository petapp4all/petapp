# PetrolApp

## 🛠 Project Overview

**PetrolApp** is a comprehensive mobile application designed to help users efficiently manage their fuel-related activities.  
Built with **React Native (Expo)** and powered by a **Node.js/Express** backend using **MongoDB** and **Prisma ORM**, the app offers the following key features:

- View the latest fuel prices in real time
- Locate the nearest filling stations using an interactive map
- Stay informed with the latest oil and gas news
- Order fuel directly from the app
- Advertise products or services related to the oil and gas industry
- Allow station owners to register and manage their fuel stations

PetrolApp bridges the gap between users and fuel service providers, creating a modern, user-friendly experience for both consumers and businesses in the petroleum sector.
